# Self-Heal-Ai
SelfHeal-AI is an AI-powered self-healing security agent for Linux servers. It monitors Apache/NGINX logs in real time, detects anomalies, blocks malicious IPs, auto-recovers crashed services, sends alerts via Telegram/Discord, checks threats via VirusTotal &amp; Zscaler, and enforces patch/firmware updates.

🛡️ SelfHeal-AI: Intelligent Server Defense & Auto-Healing Tool

📌 Project Overview

SelfHeal-AI is an intelligent, automated security system for Linux servers that:

Monitors logs in real-time (SSH, Apache, system logs)

Detects suspicious activity (brute-force, scans, anomalies)

Blocks malicious IPs dynamically (via iptables, ufw, or fail2ban)

Uses AI/ML (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection

Sends real-time alerts (Telegram, Email, Discord)

Performs self-healing (auto-restart crashed services, apply security patches)

Integrates VirusTotal API for malware checks

(Optional) Supports Zscaler API for enterprise threat intelligence

Ensures regular updates & warns about outdated firmware/unpatched systems


This project combines Linux system administration, cybersecurity, and AI in one deployable tool.

Storage: 40 GB SSD

Bandwidth: 1 TB/month (enough for logs + alerts)




---

2️⃣ Software Requirements

Operating System:

Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 LTS (recommended)

Alternatively: Debian, CentOS (minor changes needed)


Programming Language:

Python 3.8+


Python Libraries:

scikit-learn (anomaly detection)

requests (API calls: VirusTotal, Zscaler)

pyyaml (configuration files)

schedule / APScheduler (task scheduling)

psutil (system monitoring)

telegram or discord-webhook (alerting)


Security Tools:

iptables or ufw (firewall blocking)

fail2ban (log-based banning)

clamav or VirusTotal API (malware detection)


Utilities:

systemd (service management)

cron (regular updates)




---

3️⃣ External Resources

VirusTotal API Key (free tier → 500 requests/day)

Zscaler API Key (optional, enterprise only)

Telegram Bot Token or Discord Webhook (for alerts)

GitHub (version control & hosting)



---

4️⃣ Human Resources (for Academic Project Teams)

Developer / Researcher: Writes Python code & configures Ubuntu

Tester: Simulates attacks (Hydra brute-force, Nmap scans)

Documenter: Prepares report, diagrams & presentations



---

5️⃣ Minimum Setup for Demo

One Ubuntu VM (4 GB RAM, 20 GB disk)

Python 3.8+ installed

Internet access (for APIs & alerts)

Fake attack simulation using Hydra / SSH brute-force


✅ Fully demonstrable even on a laptop or free-tier cloud instance.

💼 Impact & Feasibility

✅ Academic Impact

Rated 9+/10 as a final-year project

Combines AI + Security + Automation

Practical, real-world use case

Excellent for placements & interviews


💰 Feasibility in India

Student Demo Cost: ₹0 (local laptop/VM) → ₹800/month (cloud VPS)

VirusTotal API: Free tier sufficient for academic use

Zscaler API: Enterprise only (skip for demo)

Alerts: Free via Telegram/Discord


Component	Cost (₹/month)

VPS Server	₹400 – ₹800
VirusTotal API	₹0
Zscaler API	₹0 (skip)
Maintenance	₹0 (time only)
Alerts	₹0
Total (Student)	₹400–₹800


Industry Deployment Cost: ₹3k–₹5k/month (with full APIs)

Still cheaper than enterprise SOC solutions (₹50k+)


🌍 Social & Industrial Impact

Helps SMEs & startups protect servers cheaply

Promotes cybersecurity awareness in India

Can scale to enterprise with APIs & dashboards



---

🧪 Testing Methodology

Use hydra tool to simulate SSH brute-force attacks

Run port scans with nmap

Test malware file hashes against VirusTotal API

Simulate service crashes (stop Apache) → check if auto-healed

Validate alerts (Telegram/Discord messages)
